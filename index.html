    <h1>Masoom Moitra : Final Project</h1>
<div>
  <h1> Deconstructing Latin American Immigration in the US </h1>
    <p>Data Visualization and Information Aesthetics @ The New School</p>

    <div>
      <p>This data visualization project aims to understand immigration patterns of Latin Americans in the US. The data is presented in the form of a scaled narrative. The idea is to enter this complex situation from a larger, bigger scale and then zooming into it to understand the specific region. </p>

      <p>Global Scale-
        For this project, I have explored a global scale, the Latin American scale and the South American scale. The chart below shows the general trends of immigration in the US, at a global scale.

       <p>The chart above compares cities with the top 6 immigrant populations in the US. Immigration in the US saw a big drop in the 1970s owing to stringent laws that were passed by Homeland Security. Since then, it has been rising steadily. The levels of immigration have remained steady in most cities since 2002, except California- one of the most popular cities-where a drop can be observed. </p>

       <p>The chart above show the dramatic drop in European immigration and compares it to the rise in Latin American immigration. On scaling in, more Carribean women can be observed to be settling in the North East of the US, while Mexican women usually move to the West. South American women choose the North-East, which is not a surprise as New York has the highest number of South American immigrants in the country. </p>

        <p>South American Scale-

       <p>The chart above splits immgiration rates up among countries and shows that Ecuador and Colombia see some of the highest rates of immigration. Colombia also faces the second  highest rates od deportation, while Ecuador stands third. The most number of people are deported from Brazil. </p>
